# Repository Mapper Updates

This directory contains updates to the original `universal-repo-mapper.js` script to make the documentation more universal and adaptable to different project types, without assuming specific frameworks like Angular or standard features like login pages and dashboards.

## Changes Made

The following improvements have been implemented:

1. **More Generic Routing Diagram** (in `updated-routing-diagram.js`)
   - Removed assumptions about login pages and dashboards
   - Dynamically detects routes based on codebase structure
   - Identifies API endpoints more intelligently
   - Adapts to the actual project structure

2. **Improved Module Diagram** (in `updated-module-diagram.js`)
   - Removed Angular/MVC-specific architecture assumptions
   - Creates a diagram based on discovered modules/directories
   - Categorizes modules based on naming patterns (UI, data, core, etc.)
   - Shows more realistic connections between modules

3. **Generic File Type Classifications** (in `updated-file-classifications.js`)
   - More comprehensive file type detection
   - Framework-agnostic classifications (component, service, model, etc.)
   - Detects file types based on naming patterns and directory structure
   - Added new classifications (stylesheets, resources, scripts, etc.)

4. **Universal Architecture Overview** (in `updated-architecture-overview.js`)
   - Dynamically determines the architecture type from the codebase structure
   - Identifies common architecture patterns (component-based, API/backend, etc.)
   - Describes modules and features based on actual project structure
   - Adapts descriptions to what's actually found in the code

## Implementation Instructions

To implement these changes, you have two options:

### Option 1: Replace specific functions in the original script

Replace the following functions in `universal-repo-mapper.js` with their updated versions:

1. Replace `processFile` with the version from `updated-file-classifications.js`
2. Replace `generateRoutingDiagram` with the version from `updated-routing-diagram.js`
3. Replace `generateModuleDiagram` with the version from `updated-module-diagram.js`
4. Add the new `generateArchitectureOverview` function from `updated-architecture-overview.js`
5. Update the `main` function to call `generateArchitectureOverview` instead of the hardcoded architecture section

### Option 2: Create a unified script

Copy the entire `universal-repo-mapper.js` and replace the necessary functions with the updated versions from the files mentioned above.

## Benefits of These Changes

- **More Accurate Documentation**: The generated documentation will better reflect the actual project structure
- **Universal Applicability**: Works well with any framework or project type
- **Adaptable Results**: Diagrams and descriptions adapt to what's actually in the codebase
- **No Assumptions**: Doesn't assume specific frameworks or standard features

## Testing

After implementing these changes:

1. Run the script on different types of projects
2. Verify that the generated documentation accurately represents each project
3. Check that diagrams are meaningful and reflect the actual code structure
4. Ensure no framework-specific assumptions appear in the output
